# MagicEraser

This is the final project repository for the Spring 2024 offering of CS1430: Computer Vision! Made and designed with care by Andrew, Michelle, Abhyudaya, and Aaron.

## Getting Started

Run the following command:
`pip install opencv-python ultralytics numpy`

Dependencies are also listed inside `requirements.txt`. To install from this file, run the following command: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## TODO

* Make model load actual masks instead of just the input image
* Save the model after each epoch (use tensorboard?)
* Actually train it and see what the outputs look like
* Maybe get a better GPU on AWS or GCP
* Integrate with YOLO
* Backend
